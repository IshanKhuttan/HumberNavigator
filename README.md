## Introduction
 BMP280 sensor is an environmental sensor with temperature, barometric pressure that is the next generation upgrade to the BMP085/BMP180/BMP183. This sensor is great for all sorts of weather sensing and can even be used in both I2C and SPI. This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost, precision sensing solution for measuring barometric pressure with ±1 hPa absolute accuraccy, and temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy. Because pressure changes with altitude, and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with  ±1 meter accuracy. For simple easy wiring, go with I2C. If you want to connect a bunch of sensors without worrying about I2C address collisions, then go with SPI.

 ## Build-materials-and-Budget
 The required for my whole project is just $70, but we need parts kit which we will get in Sem1 for $120. For making the connections on the breadboard some jumper wires are required. And for the PCB you can send the gerber files to the Prototype lab and get it printed, there is no cost for the PCB. For the the case also you cand the files and get it from Prototype lab for free.
