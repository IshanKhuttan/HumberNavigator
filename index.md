# Week12-Nov12
This week I have finally designed my PCB after so many problems. And i have sent it to prototype lab to get it done. My sensor, arduino and the programmer is gonna be on one side of the pcb and the display is on the other side.

And here are the connections that i have used in my circuit.

# Week11-Nov11
This week I programmed my stm32. I got my sensor(Bmp280) code working and the display(1.8 TFT ST7735) running) properly. Everything is working perfect. But the it is on the Breadboard not on PCB. Because I have to make some changes on the PCB yet.

The reading from my sensor(BMP280):

# Week10-Nov06
In this week, I worked on making cicuit on my breadboard and redesigned the pcb beacause there were some troubles in it. I have connected my 1.8 TFT display in my cicuit. I tried on power it up but it did not worked as there was some problem in the codes. I have tried to find some libraries for my sensor. As all other students worked on pcb soldering, I could not do it as I still have to add some things in my PCB.
# Week9-Oct30
In this week made the desin of PCB.

# Week8-Oct23 
In this week made the connection of the senor(BME280) with the arduino(STM32F103C8T6). And did the fritzing. I made the breadborad circuit.
