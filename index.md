# Week14-Dec03
#### Progress Report
In this week enclosed the case with the hardware and check the connections if they are working. Everything is working good. And this week the presentation is due.

# Week13-Nov27
In this week I have soldered my PCB using header pins. But I found out that the PCB is faulty as I have to change the traces for top and bottom in the PCB. So I have to redesign the PCB again and soldered it. Also Designed the case for the presentation .And also I have made the [PPT](https://github.com/IshanKhuttan/HumberNavigator/files/2622188/Presentation.pptx).

Also I have redesigned the PCB again.

Here is the Frtizing of all the hardware I have used. Also I have redesigned the fritzing because in the old fritzing I did not had the components that I have used.

# Week12-Nov20
This week I have to redesign my PCB because the PCB in week9 was faulty. The fault was that I used wrong STM32 footprint in fritzing, now I have used the right one for my fritzing file. After getting the correct footprint I made the PCB design again and sent it to prototype lab to get it made. My sensor, arduino and the programmer is going to be on one side of the PCB and the display is on the other side.

And here are the connections that I have used in my circuit.

# Week11-Nov13
This week I programmed my STM32. I got my sensor(Bmp280) code working and the display(1.8 TFT ST7735) working properly. Everything is working perfectly. But the it is on the Breadboard not on PCB. Because I have to make some changes on the PCB yet. As it was very difficult to find the connections for my arduino. Now I have to design my PCB as the breadboard connections are working.

The reading from my sensor(BMP280):

# Week10-Nov06
In this week, I worked on making the circuit on my breadboard and redesigned the PCB beacause there were some issues with it. I have connected my 1.8 TFT display in my cicuit. I tried to power it up but it did not work as there was some problem in the code. I have tried to find some libraries for my sensor. As all other students worked on PCB soldering, I could not do it as I still have to add some things in my PCB.
# Week9-Oct30
In this week made the design of the PCB but it is not correct. As the connections of the breadboard are not correct yet.

# Week8-Oct23 
In this week made the connection of the senor(BME280) with the arduino(STM32F103C8T6). And did the fritzing. I made the breadborad circuit.
